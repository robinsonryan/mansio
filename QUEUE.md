## Queued

### Support Pest 5 / PHPUnit 13 / PHP 8.4+ in the constraint matrix
- **Added**: 2026-08-07 · harness health & efficiency session — apps are queued to upgrade to Pest 5 for Tia; consuming apps can't move until this package allows it
- **Tier**: SOLO
- **Why deferred**: harness-wide decision made first; per-package constraint widening is independent work
- **Context**: current: php ^8.4, pest ^4.0. Widen composer constraints to include pest ^5 / phpunit ^13 / php 8.4+ and run the suite on the new matrix. Research + decisions: $CLAUDE_HARNESS_DIR/notes/harness-health-research-2026-08.md. Not in any manifest — register or fold in
